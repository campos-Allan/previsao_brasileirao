Making predictions of football championship in Brasil using ML, inspired by FiveThirtyEight.

### Work in progress ⌛

So far based on this [DataQuest repo](https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/football_matches), adapted to Brasil's championship and its peculiarities.

Future Updates: 
* test games from 2022
* use other attributes from fbref database to improve precision and accuracy
* test other algorithms to improve precision and accuracy
* create SPI rating for each team based on last performances and transfermarket squad value
* base new predictions around that
* try to increment the model with past conquests, rivalries and importance of each game
